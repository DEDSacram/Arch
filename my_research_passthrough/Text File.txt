I have the same nvidia driver version and for some reason prime-run command does not exist.

I just solved it by doing the following:

    Copy contents of the gist here

    #!/bin/bash
    export __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1
    export __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
    export __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only
    export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json
    exec "$@"

    Create a file ~/bin/prime-run ("~" means your home directory)
    Paste the contents there.
    Run chmod +x "~/bin/prime-run" to make it executable.

You might want to re-open your terminal or restart your session so your terminal could recognize your ~/bin folder and be able to run prime-run command, that is, if the folder is not already there.
